\chapter{Related Work}\label{chapter:relatedwork}
In this work different compilation toolchains for neutral atom architecture are considered \parencite{huang2025dasatomdivideandshuttleatomapproach,Tan_2025_Enola, schmid2023hybridcircuitmappingleveraging}.
The global goal is to determine the impact of qubit shuttling onto overall circuit fidelity and amount of gates.
Moreover, during this work will be determined drastic mismatches in benchmarks of considered toolchains. 
And a step in direction to possible fair comparison is done.

As a related work consider \parencite{gao2025optimalcompilationstrategiesqft}.
In it author tries to show possible mismatches in results of compilation because of minimal input parameters deviations, 
often substantial and difficult to rationalize discrepancies. 
Therefore, raising an important issue of fair evaluation, 
which is essential for understanding which approaches perform better or worse.

\section{My Contribution}
The idea of this work is to bench different tools for neutral atom compilation to understand what approaches are better 
and what considered hardware constraints raise significant impact on overall compilation quality.
Similarly, it is important to consider the other side of the problem shown by \parencite{gao2025optimalcompilationstrategiesqft}.
This aspect involves not only comparing discrepancies resulting by differences in input values, 
but also to determine the reasons why a minority of these inputs made the compilation process ill-conditioned.
