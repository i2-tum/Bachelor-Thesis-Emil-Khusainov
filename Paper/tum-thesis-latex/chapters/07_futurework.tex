\chapter{Future Work}\label{chapter:futurework}
Taken together, much work remains to be done. 
Firstly, such as adding new compiler toolchains for comparison 
and developing a universal framework to manage input, 
and output results, and moreover to fair calculate and interpret statistics.
Or something of greater depth, 
such as consideration of all possible parameters that take place for example in Enola but do not in other,
and due to not very big impact on calculations, frequently it is not being considered.
Moreover, different circuits could be used, with different level of start optimizations to see actually performance of a tool chain.

Very valuable scientific contribution would be to test compiler tool chain on a real hardware.
This would allow for fairer comparisons and a more accurate interpretation towards a potential unified framework.
But is it a bit difficult due to the lack of public available \ac{NAQC}. 
Particular ones of them do not expose in API a possibility to shuttle qubit in runtime, such as Aquila from Amazon.
Other, work on a very low level of analog pulses, such as Pasqal Pulser, what creates more constraints onto testing of High-level toolchains.
