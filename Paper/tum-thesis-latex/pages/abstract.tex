\ac{NAQC} are new emerging architecture in the world of quantum computations. 
Its high fidelity, native multi-qubit gates and possibility to use in \ac{DPQA} features a multitude of promises.
Moreover, \ac{DPQA} allows using physical shuttling of qubits during circuit execution instead or together with logical SWAP gates. 
All this opens up new compilation possibilities. 
Therefore, a new software tools that should take an advantage of additional capabilities of \ac{NAQC} are needed.
The goal of this work is to compare existing tool chains for compilation, that took possibility of qubit shuttling into account.
Furthermore, the solutions will be aligned at their points of calculation divergence to enable direct comparison of the algorithms they use. 
This approach will reveal potential inconsistencies present in early benchmarks 
as well as in the considered compilers' own original publications.
