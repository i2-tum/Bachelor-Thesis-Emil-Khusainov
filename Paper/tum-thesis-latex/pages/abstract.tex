\ac{NAQC} are new emerging architecture in the world of quantum computations. 
Its high fidelity, native multi-qubit gates and possibility to use in \ac{DPQA} features a lot of promises.
Moreover, \ac{DPQA} allows using physical shuttling of qubits during circuit execution instead or together with logical SWAP gates. 
All this opens up new compilation possibilities. 
Therefore, a new software tools that should take an advantage of additional capabilities of \ac{NAQC} are needed.
The goal of this work is to compare exiting tool chains for compilation, that took shuttling into account.
Moreover, the solutions will be balanced in places where they differ to compare the effectiveness of the algorithms they use and show inconsistencies in earlier benchmarks
