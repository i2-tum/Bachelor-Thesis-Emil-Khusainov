Versions for venv (Python 3.12) in this directory or for that interpreter that will run main.py
qiskit 2.0.0
qmap 0.4.1
qiskit-qasm3-import 0.5.1
mqt 0.1.1
mqt.qmap 3.0.0b2
mqt-core 3.0.2

Enabled compilers are in line 15 - 18 of main.py.

To control input consider 20 - 21.

To manipulate architecture and qasm files see absolute paths in main.py, it is possible to add your our change existing.
Consider e.g. for Hybrid Mapper variables Architecture1 and params1 in line 58-59
that could be changed accordingly to your architectures,
"Architecture" variable has a relative path to architecture template.
Could be added new architectures in json.

Foe Enola there will be a "hardware_times", "hardware_fidelities" and parameters as a dictionary in line 135 - 146

For DasAtom only "params" in line 188 could be adapted.

Do not forget to set venves for other compilers as well. Consider corresponding ReadMe.

Results will be saved then in RESULTS folder and then using Plotter.py could be plotted.
Consider that Plotter simply takes data one by one, so to plot 2,4,3 circuits it should be placed 2,3,4 in corresponding .txt in Results.
